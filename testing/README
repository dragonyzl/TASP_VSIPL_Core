This directory contains code for doing feel good tests on the TASP VSIPL
Implementation. Not every function is tested, this is a work in progress.

Simple functions (simple being defined by how hard it is to test) are done
in test_sc_simple. Harder functions are tested in there own directories.
Hopefully most directories will be obvious by there name.

Generally you sould be able to go to a directory, type make, and run the 
resulting executable (after you have made VSIPL of course). In general output
should be piped to a file and searched for error. There is a lot of output,
so trying to read it line by line would be boring unless your only testing
a couple of functions.

For more information read the README in the test_sc_simple directory.
