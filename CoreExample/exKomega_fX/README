This example needs src_VU/graphics/X files which require X window support.

Not ready for prime time so unless you know what you are doing, suggest
skiping this example.

To Make VUX functions you must go to the src_VU/grapics/X directory and
mess with the Makefile so it can find the X include files.

To make example you must mess with Makefile so linker can find X11
